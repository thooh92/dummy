#' download_fun
#'
#' allows to download radiation partitioning for closest vineyard or orchard geometry from database for 16 growth states during a vegetation period
#' These data can then be translated to a given location and given time period using [processing_function]
#'
#' Radiation Partitioning was modelled for row distances between 1 and 3.5 m, row heights between 1 and 3.5 m and row widths between 0.35 and 0.55 m.
#' If other geometries are given to the function, the closest geometry is downloaded. If these geometries are far off the closest modelled geometry a
#' a warning is created.

#' @param r_width Numeric. Enter width of a vineyard or orchard row in m in fully developed vegetation
#' @param r_height Numeric. Enter height of a vineyard or orchard row in m in fully developed vegetation
#' @param r_distance Numeric. Enter distance between vineyard or orchard rows in m in fully developed vegetation
#' @param filepath Character. Enter path where downloaded files should be stored. Defaults to working directory.
